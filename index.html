        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is the tragic protagonist of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s seminal work <i>Crime and Punishment</i>. Once an ambitious student, Raskolnikov is overcome by destitution and nihilistic thoughts, which lead him to commit a murder in the name of a philosophical ideal. His descent into guilt and madness mirrors the existential crisis of the human soul, making his story one of the most powerful psychological explorations in literary history.</p>
        <p>Through his complex internal monologues, he embodies the duality of man—his yearning for greatness and his inevitable confrontation with morality and justice. His journey from arrogance to redemption captures the turmoil of the human conscience.</p>

            <li><strong>Notes from Underground</strong> (1864) - A deep dive into existential despair.</li>
            <li><strong>The Idiot</strong> (1869) - A portrayal of absolute goodness in a corrupt world.</li>

        <h2>The Philosophy of Raskolnikov</h2>
        <p>Raskolnikov’s ideas stem from the concept of the <i>übermensch</i>, the extraordinary individual who has the right to transgress moral laws for a higher purpose. He believes that some individuals, like Napoleon, stand above conventional morality. Yet, his descent into guilt proves that even the most intellectual justifications cannot suppress the human conscience.</p>
        <p>His inner struggle is a reflection of Dostoyevsky’s recurring themes: the battle between faith and reason, morality and nihilism, redemption and suffering.</p>
